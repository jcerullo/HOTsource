Welcome New Members! <br>

<h3>Join us as we enable people to make things using technology. This is a hands-on club.  
You'll be designing and building your own tech projects with a bunch of great folks who love 
to share insights and get their hands dirty making things.<br><br>

Remember, we build things!  So over time, you will have your own collection of useful & fun things that you have 
learned to build and in doing so, you'll know how to invent things of your own.

		  <span style='margin-left:3em'>ensuring that everyone can get the most out of meetings even  <br>
		  <span style='margin-left:3em'>as newcomers. So, we've come up with a process for you to  <br>

		<h2><strong>01</strong>  JOIN THE CONVERSATION</h2>

		<h3>Since our primary communications to members is via email and forums, participating electronically is crucial to membership.   
			You will be lost if you ignore club emails and only attend meetings. </h3>

		<h3>Please join us by filling out our <a href = https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfe7KxlOJEsn1lY46h1GrGh6bZUJNYUPxqqC2j30ieTfOEYKA/viewform?usp=sf_link> MEMBERSHIP FORM.</a> </h3>

		<h2><strong>02</strong>  LEARN AT YOUR OWN PACE</h2>

		<h3> Using On-Ramps is how we bring new members up to speed.  An On-Ramp is a collection of presentations or exercises that will help integrate terms, 
			tools, and common practices used by the club into your skill set.</h3>

		<h3>There are separate On-Ramps for Small Computers and 3D Printing.  Members are strongly urged to familiarize 
			themselves with the <a href = "on-ramp.html">ON-RAMP MATERIAL </a> for a richer club experience.</h3>

        <p>
		<h2><strong>03</strong>  GET HELP WHEN NEEDED</h2>
		<h3>Learning at your own pace shouldn't be frustrating. Whether you are working on an On-Ramp exercise or your own project, 
			we offer help.  Attend a Catch-Up Session (CUS) or ask for help on our forums.  There are separate forums for Small Computers and 3D Printing.</h3>

		<h3>See the <a href = "calendar.html">CLUB CALENDAR </a>for regularly scheduled CUS sessions.  </h3>
